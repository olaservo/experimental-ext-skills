"""Plan evaluator (`kind: plan`) — skill-activation scenarios.

Tests whether the agent reads the relevant skill and produces output
(prose and/or tool-call inputs) that reflects the skill's prescriptions.

Phrase-grep evaluates against the union of the agent's final text and
all tool-call argument values. In dry-run scenarios the prescriptions
land inside the submitted script (in the call's `script` arg) rather
than in the final assistant response, so we have to look at both.

Criteria emitted:

  1. skill-read-before-plan      — read SKILL.md before any gate-tool call
                                   (or before any non-skill-read call if
                                   no gate tools are configured)
  2. plan-covers-prescriptions   — every required phrase matched somewhere
                                   in the agent's text or call args

  INFO (doesn't gate `overall`)
    - references-read              — count of reads under the skill beyond
                                     SKILL.md. High = agent followed the
                                     reference trail; low/zero is consistent
                                     with SKILL.md being self-sufficient.

Scenario YAML must declare ONE of:
  expected_skill_uri:   skill://<name>/SKILL.md         (single-skill activation)
  expected_skill_uris:  [skill://<a>/SKILL.md, ...]     (multi-skill, all required)
plus:
  required_phrases:     [{ key, any_of: [str, ...] }]   (case-insensitive)
  gate_tools:           [list of tool names]            (optional)

Multi-skill scenarios pass `skill-read-before-plan` only when *every*
listed skill's SKILL.md was read before the gate. The criterion's
`note` lists which skills were read and which were missed, e.g.
`read=[a,b] missed=[c]`. This tests cross-skill composition driven
by the host's `<available_skills>` catalog — one skill mentions
another by name, and the agent independently reads both.

`gate_tools` declares which tool calls anchor the
"skill-read-before-plan" criterion. The skill must be read before any
gate-tool invocation; calls to other tools (housekeeping like
`todo__todo_write`, read-only inspections, etc.) don't count as gates,
which avoids spurious failures on agentic clients that plan before
activating skills.

#     real action; gating against them would falsely fail any client
