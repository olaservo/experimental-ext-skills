# Scenario: pr-review

**Kind:** `pr-review` · **Server:** github-mcp-server :8082 · **YAML:** [`experiments/scenarios/pr-review.yaml`](../../../../experiments/scenarios/pr-review.yaml)

PR-review prompt run against `github-mcp-server` serving the
`pull-requests` skill as `skill://pull-requests/SKILL.md`. Probes
whether the client surfaces a resource-read at the tool-call boundary
before any mutating PR tool — the four hosts wrap that read differently
(`read_skill`, `read_mcp_resource`, `load_skill`, `activate_skill`),
which is the primary signal this scenario captures.

## Scaffold the PR

The scaffold script is idempotent — closes any open PR on
`feature/input-validation-enhancement`, rebuilds the branch, opens
fresh on `olaservo/code-review-subject`:

```bash
cd "${SUBJECT_REPO_DIR:-experiments/.workspace/code-review-subject}"
bash scripts/create-pr-input-validation.sh
```

Capture the new PR URL from the final stdout line. An exit-1 just
after `gh pr create` complaining "already exists" is not a failure —
the branch was still pushed fresh.

If the user passed `pr_number`, skip the scaffold and target that
existing open PR instead.

## Codex model on this scenario

Known-working combo on the default 200K-TPM OpenAI tier:
`CODEX_MODEL=gpt-5.1-codex CODEX_TIMEOUT_S=600`. The pr-review
scenario's `gpt-5.1-codex-mini` accumulates ~170K tokens of tool
output before writing comments and trips TPM limits repeatedly within
180s. (Plan scenarios are usually under 30s and `gpt-5.1-codex-mini`
works fine there.)

## Reporting

```bash
grep -B 1 -A 40 "Ordered tool calls:" /tmp/verify-run.log
```

Report verbatim:

- The ordered tool-call list — note whether a skill-read (`read_skill`,
  `read_mcp_resource`, `load_skill`) appears before any
  `pull_request_review_write` / `add_comment_to_pending_review` call,
  and whether the workflow follows the three-step pattern (create →
  comment(s) → submit_pending with `event` set).
- `Review URL: ...` line
- `Wall-clock: ...`

## Concurrency

Two clients running pr-review concurrently corrupts the URL report —
`_find_review_url` grabs the last review on the subject PR via `gh
api`, so another client posting during your run leaks into the URL
you return. Serialize pr-review runs.
